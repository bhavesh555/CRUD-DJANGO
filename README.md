# Django CRUD Rest API with Docker

Build a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Rest API using Django and Django Rest Framework, backed by a PostgreSQL database. This project provides a scalable and maintainable solution for creating and managing resources through a RESTful API.

## Features:

- **Django & Django Rest Framework**: Leverage the power of Django and its REST framework to quickly develop a feature-rich API with clean, reusable code.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Utilize PostgreSQL as the database backend for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Dockerized Environment**: Containerize your application for easy deployment, scalability, and consistent development across different environments.

- **Docker Compose**: Define and manage multi-container Docker applications with Docker Compose, simplifying the setup and orchestration of the entire development environment.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-api-repo.git

2. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build

3. **Access the API at http://localhost:8000/ and explore the available endpoints:**
